      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>This “place” has always been a constant in my life. I grew up in Asheville which means the Parkway wasn’t too far of a drive depending on where exactly you were heading. Now that I’ve been living in Boone for a few years and going to Appalachian State University I am still able to access the Blue Ridge Parkway, but just a different section of it.</p>

      <p>Although I am near a different part of the parkway now, many features of it are the same as the area around Asheville (much of which could be said in comparing Boone itself to Asheville). Although I am away from home, I’ve never actually felt too far away since much of the scenery is the same. I used to go to the overlooks and trails near Asheville with my family and friends from home, and I occasionally do the same thing up here with my Boone friends. If I ever need a taste of home or my younger years, I can just drive 30-40 minutes to the parkway. Much of my attraction to the area can also be attributed to my love for nature, and if I ever need a break from the complexities of modern adult life I can drive up there and think of a simpler time that I never got to live in.</p>

      <h3>Personal Story</h3>

      <p>One of the more recent times I’ve been to the Parkway was when my dog died. Life was much harder to get through knowing that boy would never run up to me again when I visited home, and I’d never be able to pet his little head again. One day I drove up to the parkway right at sunset and just watched the beautiful pinks slowly turn to vivid blues, then to darkness. This transition kind of felt like how life was going at this point, and it is weird how many metaphors for life can be found in the simplest of things in nature. I was able to have some space and think about things. I came to the realization that the sun would rise again tomorrow, there would probably be a sunset more magnificent than the one before, and that there isn’t light without darkness. All of these are things that can be related to life itself, even as we drift farther apart from the nature that originally raised us. These overlooks where you can just sit and stare at the open rolling mountains are amazing places to think about things, and we shouldn’t take being so close to nature for granted.</p>

      <h2>About</h2>
      
      <p>The Blue Ridge Parkway is a National Parkway and All-American Road in the United States, noted for its scenic beauty. It stretches 469 miles starting in North Carolina and ending in Virginia.</p> 
      
      <h3>Adjectives</h3>
      <p></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Serene</li>
        <li>Contemplative</li>
        <li>Liberating</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Best Time To Visit</h3>
      <p>It really depends on what you are doing, but sunset is always a great time to go because of how beautiful the sky looks over the mountains. The spring and summer months are best for the sunset, weather, and flora. A lot of people think fall is the best time to visit because of the autumn colors, which isn’t untrue, but as a Western North Carolina native I would advise against it due to the number of tourists and engagement photoshoots.</p>
